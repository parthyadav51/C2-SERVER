# C2-SERVER

## Customizable Command-and-Control (C2) Server

Customizable Command-and-Control (C2) Server is a powerful platform for managing and controlling multiple compromised systems remotely. It provides a centralized interface for executing commands, transferring files, and gathering information from connected clients.

## Key Features

- **Custom Payload Generation:** Generate custom payloads for Windows and Linux systems tailored to your specific requirements.
- **Payload Encoding:** Encode payloads using various techniques to evade detection by antivirus software and intrusion detection systems (IDS).
- **Static Listener Configuration:** Configure static listeners to listen for incoming connections on predefined IP addresses and ports.
- **PowerShell Download Cradle:** Deploy payloads using PowerShell download cradles, enabling agents to download and execute payloads directly from the Internet.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Access an intuitive web interface for monitoring connected clients, executing commands, managing files, and scheduling tasks conveniently through a web browser.
- **Secure Communication:** Ensure secure communication between the C2 server and connected clients through encryption, protecting against unauthorized access and eavesdropping.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. **Configuration:** Configure the C2 server settings, including listener configurations and encryption parameters.
3. **Payload Generation:** Generate custom payloads for target Windows and Linux systems using the provided tools.
4. **Payload Deployment:** Deploy the generated payloads to target systems using various deployment methods.
5. **Web Interface:** Access the interactive web interface to monitor and interact with connected clients, execute commands, manage file transfers, and schedule tasks conveniently.

## Future Plans

- **Deploy on the Internet:** Convert this project to a fully functional web interface using Flask and deploy it on the internet.
- **Enhanced Payloads:** Develop advanced payloads for Windows, Linux, and Android. Ensure these payloads can provide sessions for interaction when injected into any system.
- **Community Collaboration:** Foster a robust community around this tool for shared learning and development. Anyone interested in contributing to the project is welcome.
